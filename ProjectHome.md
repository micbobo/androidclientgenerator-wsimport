This project provides a tool to generate client code from the WSDL for simple SOAP based Web Services. The generated code can be used in conjunction with the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/'>ksoap2-android</a> library.

It uses JAX-WS bindings such that when the same bindings are used to auto generate client for J2SE using the J2SE tool wsimport version 2.0, the interface of the client generated by the tool and the wsimport tool is the same

The idea is to enable an application developer to use the same code to access the web service, regardless of the platform: J2SE or Android.

This project started as an in house project during work on the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/srijan-toolkit/'>srijan toolkit</a> with the <a href='https://www-roc.inria.fr/arles/'>ARLES project team at INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt</a>
